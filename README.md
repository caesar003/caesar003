Iâ€™m a frontend developer with a deep passion for transforming design concepts into clean, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces. My day-to-day involves delving into complex documentation, experimenting with design prototypes, and seamlessly integrating frontends with backend APIs.

When Iâ€™m not perfecting pixel-perfect layouts or fine-tuning animations, I enjoy building tools that boost productivity and streamline workflows. Dive into my coding arsenal below to see the tools and scripts Iâ€™ve created to simplify the developer experience.

### ðŸ›  Coding Arsenal

- **[Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)**  
  My customized Kitty terminal configuration, fine-tuned for speed and flexibility. [Configuration here](https://github.com/caesar003/kitty.conf).

- **[Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)**  
  A Tmux setup optimized for efficient multi-session management. [Configuration here](https://github.com/caesar003/tmux-config).
- **[Neovim](https://neovim.io/)**  
   My Neovim journey started by clearing out my Lua configuration folder and beginning with a single, empty `init.lua`. Through countless trials and errors, experimenting with plugins and setups that didnâ€™t quite fit, I eventually crafted a configuration that feels like home. Itâ€™s a reflection of my workflow and preferencesâ€”it might not suit everyone, but itâ€™s uniquely mine. [Configuration here](https://github.com/caesar003/nvimconfig).
- **[Vim](https://www.vim.org/)**  
  For quick edits and note-taking, Vim is my go-to. [Configuration here](https://github.com/caesar003/vimrc).

- **KSession (Kitty Session Manager)**  
  A custom tool for managing multiple Kitty tabs with saved configurations. [Explore it here](https://github.com/caesar003/ksession).

- **TLM (Tmux Layout Manager)**  
  Easily save and load your favorite Tmux layouts with JSON configurations for an organized setup. [Get it here](https://github.com/caesar003/tlm).

- **Gitlog**  
  Summarize monthly activity across multiple repositoriesâ€”ideal for managing multiple projects. [See it here](https://github.com/caesar003/gitlog).

- **Togler**  
  Inspired by dropdown terminals, this script makes apps I defined are one keypress away. [Check it out here](https://github.com/caesar003/togler.git).

- **Theme-switch**  
  A tool for seamlessly toggling between dark and light themes, perfect for adapting to changing lighting environments. [Find it here](https://github.com/caesar003/theme-switch.git).

- **Todo**  
  Sure, there are countless fancy, feature-rich tools for task management out there, but building my own lets me learn and control exactly what I need! Plus, there's nothing like the satisfaction of creating something that fits my workflow perfectly. [Explore it here](https://github.com/caesar003/todo.git).

- **Noted**  
  Exactly, the world doesnâ€™t need another note-taking tool, right? But building my own has been a fun and rewarding challenge! With `noted`, I can jot down thoughts, organize them my way, and truly make the tool feel like an extension of my workflow. After all, nothing beats the satisfaction of crafting something thatâ€™s tailored to your needs. [Explore it here](https://github.com/caesar003/noted.git).

### ðŸ”§ Tech Stack & Interests
